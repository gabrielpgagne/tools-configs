# tools-configs
My personal configurations for my dev tools.

# Usage

The main script is `configs.sh`. It can be ran in "import mode" or in "export mode".

## Import mode
Import mode is used to apply the configs to your computer.

In your terminal, just run:

`source ./configs.sh i`

"i" can be anything, the script enters Import mode whenever it's launched with arguments.

## Export mode
Export mode is used to backup the configs to your local repo.

In your terminal, just run:

`source ./configs.sh`

_with no arguments_.
